### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Walid Abdullah
#### Web Developer


Iâ€™m a Front End Web developer passionate about making error-free websites with 100% client satisfaction. I am passionate about learning and sharing my knowledge with others as publicly as possible. I love to solve real-world problems. I am strategic and goal-oriented, and I always work with an end goal in mind. Over the past years, I created 100s of websites for my clients. I pride myself on doing quality work and maintaining excellent communication. Most of the time I work with WordPress but some technologies I enjoy working with include HTML, CSS as well as JavaScript.
